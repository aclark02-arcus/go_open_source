You are not the first person to have done this project, but you've done it really well.

# What does "going open-source" mean?

Convert the code into a template that folks can use to pivot into their needs. The point of going open-source is to propel the industry forward, by adopting a centralized methods for accomplishing a certain task or workflow. 

--- 

# But what does it really mean?

It means that you as a maintainer don't exist to serve other's needs. But it does mean, you act as a steward of the code to help guide and direct it towards its highest and best use.

The repo exists to help other's engage with the code project and contribute meaningful ideas and/or code to make it better over time.

---

# Selfish Perks:
- You can get valuable external feedback, potential identify "blind spots" that you had during development
- Could gain "free" resources that help contribute towards future goals of the project
- Putting your code out there helps you & your organization point to a high-caliber project which could be used for recruitment purposes.

---

# Assurances:
- No sharing of private data, ever
  - Openly, we can share publicly available data, dummy data, or simulated data
- No invitations to outside collaborators
	- You as a GitHub Org & Admin can control who wishes to contribute code to the repository.
- No compromising code
	- (1) only trusted developers will be on the project, as mentioned above
	- (2) You can set branch protection rules to dictate when code can be merged
	- (3) You can always revert changes - the beauty of version control!
	- More on this later!

# Where to host the code:
- GCP-Service International's own GitHub page
- Small private collab space between GCP & a few other orgs
- Pharma open-source incubators
	- [pharmaverse](https://github.com/pharmaverse)
	- [openpharma](https://github.com/openpharma)
	- [Open Source In Pharma](https://github.com/opensourceinpharma)... previously r/Pharma
	- [Phuse](https://github.com/phuse-org)
	- [R Consortium](https://github.com/RConsortium)
	
Notes: there are benefits from working from a perceived "neutral host" location

# Initial collaboration questions:

- Where are you at in development?
	- Experimental
	- stable
	- sun-setting
- How much time do you want to put into this project?
- How many contributors do you already have? How many resources (time & energy) do we all have? Be realistic

# Potential fears
As a maintainer, you are not a slave to the community. You don't live to serve them. You already served them by sharing code. They now how an opportunity to engage with that code experiment. We can manage expectations in the README & contributing guidelines and code of conduct. You can point to these things and say: "we don't do that here".

Someone's going to incorporate bugs. That's what unit tests are for! And CI!

Will I be tied to maintaining this the rest of my life? It's also okay to abandon projects. Someone else can pick up if they need.

---

# Other considerations
- Licensing
- create new github handles tied to your employer? Arcus & pfizer do it

It's worth the time to learn to open-source.

<!-- # Why do I care? -->

<!-- * As a shiny developer, we often times spend vast amounts of time programming a user experience everyone can appreciate, so having people use and appreciate your hard work feels good, and it means you've created something truly valuable. -->

<!-- - Encourage you: use them! -->


<!-- --- -->
<!-- class: inverse, center, middle -->
<!-- # bit.ly -->

<!-- Don't overlook the power of monitoring clicks! -->

<!-- --- -->

<!-- # bit.ly -->

<!-- What is it? -->

<!-- * Basically a free URL shortener that also counts URL clicks -->

<!-- -- -->

<!-- Why use it? -->


<!-- * Know you if users are opening your app -->

<!-- -- -->

<!-- * Also great for conferences when demo-ing an app to measure audience engagement -->

<!-- -- -->

<!-- * Handy elsewhere - for example: on your app's documentation link(s)! -->

<!-- -- -->

<!-- When to use? -->

<!-- * I'd recommend for public-facing URLs, since you don't want to "upload" a private URL to a public site like bit.ly. -->

<!-- --- -->

<!-- # How do I create a bit.ly link? -->

<!-- Copy & paste a (long) link into their link shortener, and customize the back half to start collecting stats! -->

<!-- ![bit.ly example](images/bitly_example.PNG) -->

<!-- ### Easy peasy -->

<!-- --- -->
<!-- class: inverse, center, middle -->
<!-- # Google Analytics -->

<!-- Google Analytics is a free service that collects information about who visits your website and what they do while they're there. -->

<!-- -- -->

<!-- Best used when you have a public facing app (i.e. shinyapps.io) -->

<!-- --- -->
<!-- # Google Analytics: Getting Started -->

<!-- * Create an account (analytics.google.com) -->

<!-- -- -->

<!-- * Find your tracking code for your website (aka property) -->

<!-- ```{js, eval = FALSE} -->
<!-- /*<!-- Global site tag (gtag.js) - Google Analytics -->*/ -->
<!-- <script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-ThisIsNotReal"> -->
<!-- <script> -->
<!--   window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || []; -->
<!--   function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);} -->
<!--   gtag('js', new Date()); -->

<!--   gtag('config', 'G-ThisIsNotReal'); -->
<!-- </script> -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- --- -->
<!-- # Google Analytics: Getting Started (cont'd) -->

<!-- * Add it to the app -->

<!-- ```{r, eval = FALSE} -->
<!-- # somewhere inside the UI -->
<!-- shiny::tags$head( -->
<!--   shiny::tags$script( -->
<!--     src = "https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-ThisIsNotReal", -->
<!--     async = "" -->
<!--   ), -->
<!--   shiny::tags$script( -->
<!--     src = "www/gtag.js" -->
<!--   ) -->
<!-- ) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- --- -->

<!-- # Google Analytics: Getting Started (cont'd) -->

<!-- * Redeploy & test -->

<!-- After deployment & visiting shiny app site, you may have to wait about 1 - 2 minutes (max) before data stream flowing into GA report. -->

<!-- <br> -->

<!-- ![GA_visits](images/ga_first_time_usage.PNG) -->
<!-- --- -->
<!-- class: inverse, center, middle -->
<!-- # Track events with GA -->

<!-- Note: requires some javascript knowledge! -->

<!-- --- -->
<!-- # Tracking events w/ GA -->

<!-- Let's say you have the following dropdown input, like in the [forest ranges shiny app](https://demo.prod.appsilon.ai/forest-ranges/). -->

<!-- ```{r, eval=FALSE} -->
<!-- shiny.semantic::dropdown_input( -->
<!--   input_id = ns("tree_specie"), -->
<!--   choices = c("Baltic Pine", "European silver fir", "Douglas fir"), -->
<!--   choices_value = c("Pinus Slyvestris", "Abies Alba", "Albus Dumbledore"), -->
<!--   default_text = "Tree species", -->
<!--   value = "Douglas fir" -->
<!-- ) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- ### Finding an element -->
<!-- `dropdown_input` generates a dropdown menu where each element has a class `item`, so since this is our only dropdown in the app, we can find this element pretty easily using `$('.item')` jQuery Syntax. -->

<!-- --- -->
<!-- ## Finding an element can be tough -->

<!-- In chrome, right click on the element and select `inspect` to pull up the developer console. There, you can weed through the html looking for classes or `id`s specific to the element: -->


<!-- ![inspect](images/inspect.PNG) -->

<!-- --- -->
<!-- # Add an event listener -->

<!-- ```{js, eval=FALSE} -->
<!-- $('.item').on('click', (event) => { -->
<!--   const selectedSpecie = $(event.currentTarget).data().value; -->
<!--   gtag('event', 'specie_selected', { -->
<!--     selected_specie: selectedSpecie -->
<!--   }); -->
<!-- }); -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- **^^^ Sends the data to GA:** -->

<!-- ![Event Tracked](images/ga_event_tracked.PNG) -->

<!-- --- -->
<!-- class: inverse, center, middle -->
<!-- # Matomo Analytics -->

<!-- Google Analytics, but open source, offering an on-prem opportunity. I suggest using when you have a private, enterprise app (i.e. internal Shiny Server or RS Connect). -->

<!-- -- -->

<!-- Basically the same approach as GA, so we'll skip the "how to". -->

<!-- # {shinylogs} -->



<!-- --- -->

<!-- # `{shinylogs}` -->

<!-- Logging tool for Shiny applications: record inputs or outputs changes, and info about userâ€™s session. All recording is done client-side to not slow down the application and occupy the server. -->

<!-- ### Install -->
<!-- ```{r, eval=FALSE} -->
<!-- # From CRAN -->
<!-- install.packages("shinylogs")  -->

<!-- # From Github -->
<!-- remotes::install_github("dreamRs/shinylogs") -->
<!-- ``` -->


<!-- --- -->

<!-- # `{shinylogs}` Usage -->

<!-- Call the main function `track_usage()` in server part of application, and specify where to write logs: -->

<!-- ```{r, eval=FALSE} -->
<!-- # UI -->
<!-- use_tracking() -->

<!-- # server -->
<!-- track_usage(storage_mode = store_json(path = "logs/")) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- -- -->


<!-- The function will record : -->

<!-- * **inputs**: each time an input changes, the name, time stamp and value will be saved -->
<!-- * **errors**: errors propagated through outputs -->
<!-- * **outputs**: each time an output is re-generated -->
<!-- * **session**: information about userâ€™s browser and the application -->


<!-- --- -->

<!-- # `{shinylogs}` Storage modes  -->
<!-- Six modes are available: -->

<!-- * **store_json()**: store logs has separate JSON files (one by session). -->

<!-- -- -->

<!-- * **store_rds()**: store logs has individually RDS files (one by session). -->

<!-- -- -->

<!-- * **store_sqlite()**: store logs in a SQLite database. -->

<!-- -- -->

<!-- * **store_null()**: donâ€™t write logs on disk, print them in R console. -->

<!-- -- -->

<!-- * **store_custom()**: use a custom function to save logs wherever you want. -->

<!-- -- -->

<!-- * **store_googledrive()**: store logs(as JSON files) in Googledrive. -->


<!-- --- -->
<!-- class: inverse, center, middle -->
<!-- # Deployment with `{shinylogs}` -->

<!-- Each storage mode comes in handy for different deployment environment. -->

<!-- --- -->
<!-- Deployment with `{shinylogs}` -->
<!-- # Shiny server, RStudio Connect -->

<!-- On a server, if you want to save logs on disk, donâ€™t forget to set write permission on the folder you want to save logs. -->

<!-- On RStudio Connect, you need to use an absolute path to specify the directory where to save logs. You can find more information here: [Persistent Storage on RStudio Connect](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007981134-Persistent-Storage-on-RStudio-Connect). -->

<!-- --- -->
<!-- Deployment with `{shinylogs}` -->
<!-- # shinyapps.io -->

<!-- Thereâ€™s no persistent data storage! So you canâ€™t save logs as JSON or RDS files, you have to use a **remote storage method**. For example, you can send logs to Google Drive with store_googledrive or use store_custom to send logs wherever you want (dropbox, a remote database, etcâ€¦). -->

<!-- To use Google Drive, youâ€™ll need to work with Googleâ€™s API and set auth to your account, see [`{gargle}` documentation](https://gargle.r-lib.org/index.html) for examples and how to. -->

<!-- --- -->
<!-- Deployment with `{shinylogs}` -->
<!-- # ShinyProxy -->

<!-- With [ShinyProxy](https://www.shinyproxy.io/), you can use a Docker volume to write logs outside of the application container. In `application.yml`, you use can something like this in the specs describing the application: -->

<!-- > container-volumes: [ "/var/log/shinylogs:/root/logs" ] -->

<!-- `/var/log/shinylogs` is a directory on the server where you deploy your applications with ShinyProxy. `/root/logs` is a directory inside your Docker image, itâ€™s the path you can use in `track_usage()`, e.g. : -->

<!-- ``` -->
<!-- track_usage( -->
<!--   storage_mode = store_json(path = "/root/logs") -->
<!-- ) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- --- -->
<!-- class: inverse, center, middle -->
<!-- # Information recorded by `{shinylogs}` -->

<!-- --- -->
<!-- ## Session Info -->

<!-- Metadata about the application and the userâ€™s browser: -->

<!-- * **app**: name of the application -->

<!-- * **user**: name of the user (if using Shiny-server pro for example) -->

<!-- * **server_connected**: when application has been launched (server time) -->

<!-- * **sessionid**: a session ID to match the session with other recorded tables -->

<!-- * **server_disconnected**: when the application was disconnected (server time) -->

<!-- * **user_agent**: browser user-agent -->

<!-- * **screen_res**: resolution of the user screen (width x height) -->

<!-- * **browser_res**: resolution of the user browser (width x height) -->

<!-- * **pixel_ratio**: pixel ratio of the browser -->

<!-- * **browser_connected**: when application has been launched. Uses browser time, which depends on user timezone. -->

<!-- --- -->
<!-- Information recorded by `{shinylogs}` -->
<!-- ## Session: example -->

<!-- ![Session Example](images/shinylogs session info.PNG) -->
<!-- --- -->
<!-- Information recorded by `{shinylogs}` -->
<!-- ## Inputs -->

<!-- Data about inputs, by default all inputs are recorded (even those not define by developer, like with {htmlwidgets} : {DT}, {leaflet}, â€¦) -->

<!-- * **sessionid**: the same ID as in session object -->

<!-- * **name**: the inputs inputId -->

<!-- * **timestamp**: timestamp when the input has changed -->

<!-- * **value**: the value taken by the input (can be a list in case of complex input) -->

<!-- * **type**: type of input (if defined) -->

<!-- * **binding**: binding for the input (if defined) -->

<!-- --- -->
<!-- Information recorded by `{shinylogs}` -->
<!-- ## Inputs: example -->


<!-- ![Inputs Example](images/shinylogs inputs.PNG) -->

<!-- --- -->
<!-- Information recorded by `{shinylogs}` -->
<!-- ## Outputs -->

<!-- Data recorded each time an output is refreshed: -->

<!-- * **sessionid**: the same ID as in session object -->

<!-- * **name**: outputId of the output -->

<!-- * **timestamp**: timestamp when the output has been updated -->

<!-- * **type**: type of output (if defined) -->

<!-- * **binding**: binding for the output (if defined) -->

<!-- --- -->
<!-- Information recorded by `{shinylogs}` -->
<!-- ## Outputs: example -->


<!-- ![Outputs Example](images/shinylogs outputs.PNG) -->

<!-- --- -->
<!-- Information recorded by `{shinylogs}` -->
<!-- ## Errors -->

<!-- Errors are recorded only when propagated through an output, this is the red message users see in application, info saved are: -->

<!-- * **sessionid**: the same ID as in session object -->

<!-- * **name**: outputId of the output where an error happened -->

<!-- * **timestamp**: timestamp of the error -->

<!-- * **error**: error message (if any) -->

<!-- * **value**: additional data for the error (generally NULL) (if defined) -->

<!-- --- -->
<!-- Information recorded by `{shinylogs}` -->
<!-- ## Errors: example -->


<!-- ![Errors Example](images/shinylogs errors.PNG) -->

<!-- class: inverse, center, middle -->

<!-- # `{shiny.stats}` -->

<!-- Yet another way to log user data -->

<!-- --- -->
<!-- # `{shiny.stats}` -->

<!-- Easy way for logging usersâ€™ activity **and** creating a dashboard to ingest the data. The only requirement is that you have an accessible database, which can be as simple as a local PostgreSQL database or a sqlite file. -->

<!-- First step is installation: -->
<!-- ```{r, eval=FALSE} -->
<!-- devtools::install_github("Appsilon/shiny.stats") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- --- -->
<!-- # `{shiny.stats}` Set up -->


<!-- The next step is to initialize the database you want to use with shiny.stats. You should only do this once. The snippet below will connect to a sqlite database named user_stats: -->

<!-- ```{r, eval=FALSE} -->
<!-- connection <- DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), dbname = "user_stats.sqlite") -->
<!-- DBI::dbDisconnect(connection) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- --- -->
<!-- # `{shiny.stats}` Set up (cont'd) -->

<!-- Now comes the potentially tricky part (depending on how your appâ€™s authentication is set up): youâ€™ll need to define a function to extract the username. The below example will extract it from the URL, from a dedicated username parameter. -->
<!-- ```{r, eval=FALSE} -->
<!-- get_user <- function(session) { -->
<!--   parseQueryString(isolate(session$clientData$url_search))$username -->
<!-- } -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- --- -->
<!-- # `{shiny.stats}` Server Side Logic -->

<!-- The magic happens in the server function where the database connection is established and user behavior is monitored: -->

<!-- ```{r, eval=FALSE} -->
<!-- # creates user connection list and ensures required tables exist in DB -->
<!-- user_connection <- initialize_connection(connection, -->
<!--                                          username = get_user(session)) -->

<!-- # register login -->
<!-- log_login(user_connection) -->

<!-- # register actions to watch... -->
<!-- log_click(user_connection, id = "apply_slider") # button -->
<!-- log_input(user_connection, input, input_id = "bins") # slider -->

<!-- # registering logout -->
<!-- log_logout(user_connection) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- --- -->
<!-- # View `{shiny.stats}` database -->

<!-- Open the sqlite file in your favorite database management tool -->

<!-- ![shiny.stats view db](images/shiny.stats tableplus.png) -->
<!-- --- -->
<!-- # Built-in `{shiny.stats}` dashboard -->

<!-- The most handy feature of `{shiny.stats}`? You can easily display usersâ€™ stats in an R Shiny dashboard. The following example code snippet creates a dashboard that allows you to monitor user adoption: -->

<!-- ```{r, eval=FALSE} -->
<!-- library(shiny);library(RSQLite);library(shiny.stats); -->

<!-- # prepare credentials list to access logs: -->
<!-- db_credentials <- list(DB_NAME = "user_stats.sqlite", -->
<!--                        DB_DRIVER = "SQLite") -->

<!-- # define function for extracting username -->
<!-- get_user <- function(session) { -->
<!--   username <- isolate(parseQueryString(session$clientData$url_search)$username) -->
<!--   req(username) -->
<!--   return(username) -->
<!-- } -->

<!-- # define ui and server -->
<!-- ui <- shiny_stats_ui() -->
<!-- server <- shiny_stats_server(get_user, db_credentials = db_credentials) -->
<!-- shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server, -->
<!--          options = list(port = 8887, launch.browser = FALSE)) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## Teaser -->
<!-- Future goal of `{connectapi}` - anything clickable in the UI can be mimicked programmatically via the API. -->
